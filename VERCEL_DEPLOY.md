# 🚀 EduPlan Assistant - Vercel Deployment Guide

*Hey! Kevin here again! 👋 Now I'm gonna show you how to deploy my AI app to Vercel super easily!*

## 📋 What You'll Need

- ✅ A GitHub account (free)
- ✅ A Vercel account (free)
- ✅ Your OpenAI API key and prompt details
- ✅ About 10 minutes of time

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
# or
yarn global add vercel
```

### Step 2: Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```

### Step 3: Deploy Your App
```bash
# Make sure you're in your project directory
cd /path/to/teacher-ai-helper

```

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables
After deployment, add your environment variables:

```bash
# Add OpenAI API Key
vercel env add OPENAI_API_KEY

# Add OpenAI Prompt ID
vercel env add OPENAI_PROMPT_ID

vercel env add OPENAI_PROMPT_VERSION
```

Or set them in the Vercel Dashboard:

2. Click "Settings" 
3. Click "Environment Variables"
4. Add each variable

### Step 5: Redeploy with Environment Variables
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## 🔧 Alternative: Deploy via GitHub

### Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub

6. Add environment variables in the dashboard
7. Deploy! 🚀

### Option B: Manual GitHub Setup
```bash
# Push to GitHub first
git add .
git commit -m "Add Vercel deployment config 🚀"
git push origin main

# Then import in Vercel dashboard
```
